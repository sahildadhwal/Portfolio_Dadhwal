# Sahil Dadhwal's Portfolio Site

Welcome to my portfolio site! This project is currently under development, created during my free time while interning at BTIS as a Data Engineer. The goal is to replicate the aesthetics of a Macintosh device while showcasing my skills in various areas such as data engineering, web development, and software design.

As of now, the portfolio is constructed using HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JS.

## Features

- **Macintosh Interface**: Mimics the look and feel of a Macintosh desktop environment.
- **Projects Showcase**: Displays my projects, achievements, and experiences.
- **Resume**: Provides access to my resume for more details about my professional background.
- **GitHub Pages**: Visit my portfolio live at [https://sahildadhwal.github.io/Portfolio_Dadhwal/](https://sahildadhwal.github.io/Portfolio_Dadhwal/).

Feel free to explore and get in touch if you have any feedback or questions!
